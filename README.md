# PinballMachine
This is a Python pinball machine created by Carol and Emily.
We used the turtle library in Python to create our project.
Our game starts when the ball on the right side of the board is launched. The player can change the velocity of the initial launch by pressing the space key where more presses will generate a faster launch. The color of the launcher also shows how fast the ball will move where the colors progresses in the following order: green, yellow, orange, red.
The ball will first move up the tube at a constant velocity and curve over to the main board where all of the obstacles and flippers are. There, gravity will act on it and pull it down the board at a constant acceleration. This acceleration is not equal to 9.81 m/s^2 because our board is tilted at a 10º angle.
